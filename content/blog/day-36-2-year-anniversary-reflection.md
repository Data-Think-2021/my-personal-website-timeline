✨ Today I celebrate my 2-year anniversary at NOW GmbH – and it feels like a journey I never expected to take.

Two years ago, I pictured myself as a Senior Data Engineer, deepening my technical skills. Becoming Head of Data & Cloud? That was never part of the plan.

Then came the period of transformation. When a major gap in AWS Cloud appeared, I stepped in — taking on more responsibility than my role required to ensure our infrastructure stable. I organized an AWS certification sprint and Hackathon for colleagues — something far outside my job description, but something I believed would help the company and colleagues.

At the same time, I discovered my passion: building communities, sharing knowledge, and empowering others through the Data Science group and internal women networks.

That&apos;s when everything shifted — I stopped seeing myself only as a technical expert and started realizing the impact I could make as a leader and community builder. I grew more confident, found a lot of joy in my work. It felt like the most natural path forward.

This promotion a month ago was the greatest recognition of my work here.

## 🙏 I would like to thank many of you and many best things the NOW offer:

- **My former team and all the lovely and supportive colleagues I worked with**

- **The freedom to take initiative and make an impact**

- **Complex projects, challenging problems, and lot of data ;)**

- **A company culture that values transparency, flexibility and trust**

I&apos;m excited to keep growing, leading, and shaping a better NOW.
