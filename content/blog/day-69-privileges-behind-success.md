On LinkedIn, we often see people sharing their success stories — but we seldom talk about the privileges that make those successes possible.

As some of you may have read, I&apos;ve been sharing my journey from being a full-time mom to becoming a data leader. **The hard work, learning, and persistence behind it are real** — but I also want to be honest about the three privileges that made my path a bit easier than it might be for other foreigners:

## 🇩🇪 German

Even though I started with zero German, but I could learn and practice my German with my current husband since day 1.

## 💼 Work Permission

I would have a work permit after two years and a residence permit after five years. This means that I can change jobs without worrying about visa issues.

## 💰 Financial

My family supported me. I didn&apos;t need to worry about the financial issue when I decided to invest time and money in studying again and rebuilding my career.

Many of my friends — especially those with foreign backgrounds — don&apos;t have the same resource. Their challenges are different, and often harder. So if that&apos;s you: **please don&apos;t feel bad. You are already doing your best.** 🌱

In my upcoming podcast, I&apos;ll talk more about this journey — not just about success, but about regaining independence and freedom. The link to register will be shared in the comment.

Dear friends, have you ever considered the privileges you have over others?
