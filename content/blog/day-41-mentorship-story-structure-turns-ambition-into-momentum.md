#MentorshipStory 1/2

I&apos;m currently mentoring a brilliant master&apos;s student who will graduate in December and is now looking for her first data job in the U.S.

In her words: &quot;The job market is brutal.&quot;

And it&apos;s true — breaking into data as a new graduate takes more than just skills. It takes structure, focus, and emotional resilience.

Together, we started by defining her one-year goal — not just &quot;get a job&quot;, but &quot;get a role that builds her technical and storytelling skills in data.&quot;

Then, we broke it down into smaller, measurable steps:

✅ **Update CV with quantifiable impact**

✅ **Tailor 3–5 quality applications per day**

✅ **Add keywords from each job description**

✅ **Share one insight weekly on LinkedIn**

We meet once a month — I provide feedback, perspective, and motivation when the search feels long.

## 💡 What I&apos;ve learned as a mentor:

**Ambition is not enough — structure turns ambition into momentum.**

If you&apos;re mentoring someone entering tech, remember: small, clear goals create the confidence to move forward.
