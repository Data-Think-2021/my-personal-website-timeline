Yesterday I finally met Alexey — the amazing mind behind DataTalks.Club — in person over lunch.

He&apos;s every bit as humble and kind as you&apos;d imagine.

Five years ago, fresh out of graduation, I followed him and saw how he built the most meaningful open source community DataTalks.Club step by step. Their community has grown to over 80,000 members in time for their 5-year anniversary.

Over the years, I&apos;ve taken several of their courses in my free time — evenings and weekends — including the MLOps Zoomcamp, Data Engineering Zoomcamp, and a fresh some session of Machine Learning Zoomcamp.

I absolutely love these courses because they&apos;re so practical — built around real-world architectures, tools, and technologies — and taught by Alexey and other professionals who actually work in the field.

## Those courses opened doors for me — twice.

They helped me land two amazing roles: first as a Consultant in Data & AI at Deloitte, and later as a Data Engineer at my current company, where I now serve as Head of Data & Cloud.

Next month, in November, I&apos;ll be joining Alexey on his podcast to share my journey — from a full-time mom to Head of Data & Cloud.

We&apos;ll talk about my experience with public learning, the challenges I&apos;ve faced as an immigrant woman and mother in Germany, the hard lessons along the way, and some personal advice I hope will inspire others.

It&apos;ll be my very first podcast — and honestly, I&apos;m both excited and nervous.

✨ **Thank you Alexey!**

🎙️ Stay tuned for the episode — and tell me, **Who in your learning journey has inspired you the most?**
