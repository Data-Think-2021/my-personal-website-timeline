A gentle ask to the data leaders in my network 👋

I&apos;m now 85 days into my role as Head of Data & Cloud, and I&apos;m deep in the exciting (and daunting) challenge of shaping our integrated data and cloud strategy from the ground up.

This isn&apos;t just about picking tools or building a lot of dashboards; it&apos;s about aligning every data decision with the company&apos;s core mission. Inspired by the post about data strategy from Shachar Meir, a good data strategy should support business goals and purpose.

The following pillars should be included. I wonder did I miss something:

## The Six Pillars

1. **Data Governance:** Standards, quality, ownership, and regulatory compliance.

2. **Data Architecture:** Defining how data flows, where it lives, and how it&apos;s modeled.

3. **Data Infrastructure:** Moving towards a Hybrid Model (on-premise and cloud) for flexibility and scale.

4. **Data Literacy &amp; Culture:** Ensuring the organization can actually use the data effectively.

5. **People &amp; Process:** Our operating model and crucial &apos;make vs. buy&apos; decisions.

6. **Success KPIs:** Defining what &apos;winning&apos; looks like.

Here&apos;s my three questions for those of you who have successfully built and implemented a unified Data &amp; Cloud Strategy:

## 🤔 Question 1

Should data and cloud strategy be defined hands-in-hand or separately?

## 🤔 Question 2

Like Cloud/IT Security be its own top-level pillar, or is it purely a component of Governance/Infrastructure? Did I miss any pillar?

## 🤔 Question 3

Who should be involved in drafting this data strategy?

Thank you in advance for your insight! 👇
