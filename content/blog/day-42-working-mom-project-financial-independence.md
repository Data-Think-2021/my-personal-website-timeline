Financial independence isn&apos;t just about money — it&apos;s about confidence, choices, and freedom.

That&apos;s why I started the &quot;Working Mom Project&quot; to help women return to work and rebuild their independence.

Over the years, I&apos;ve seen many highly qualified women give up their careers to stay at home. When they decide to return to work after their children grow up, they often find it incredibly difficult to re-enter the job market or to find roles that match their true potential.

Through my experience, I&apos;ve learned that financial independence is one of the most important pillars in a marriage.

It empowers women — and in turn, strengthens the entire family.

One of my current mentees is a single mom of two young kids who decided to re-enter the workforce after a five-year break.

Her dream: to become financially independent through her creative and freelance work as a Host and Speaker and her newly founded Full-Service Advertising Agency, offering creative content in text, video, photo, and graphic design.

If you&apos;re looking for a passionate freelancer or creative partner — I highly recommend connecting with her!

We focused on breaking the big goal into small, achievable milestones:

📈 **Build her first network and audience** — from 0 to 500+ meaningful connections

🎯 **Get her first project** — by creating a strong freelance profile and applying proactively

💼 **Build her portfolio** — showcasing her best work and testimonials

🤖 **Use AI tools** — to design her website, logo, and service portfolio

Each small step has helped her become a stronger, more confident version of herself.

Our plan is to meet and reflect on her progress each month— and until now every time, she exceeds expectations and reaches beyond her goals.

This journey is definitely tough. I know that firsthand — I started as a stay-at-home mom of two small kids, and step by step built my path into the tech and data field alone.

Luckily, she doesn&apos;t walk this path alone.

My role is to give perspective and structure and be her cheerleader — reminding her that every small action is a step toward independence. 💜

## 💡 Empowerment doesn&apos;t always come from big wins.

Sometimes, it&apos;s about helping someone believe again in their own potential.
