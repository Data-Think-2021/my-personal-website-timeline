I often hear developers say: "I am a developer and only care about code."
And honestly, that makes me a little sad. Because code alone doesn't solve a business problem.

Last Friday, I was at the IAA Mobility as an exhibitor for Nationale Leitstelle Ladeinfrastruktur under the roof of NOW GmbH.

I had conversations with people from very different backgrounds: industry experts, academic researchers, curious visitors, potential partners. Some gave us positive feedback on charging infrastructure and electric vehicles. Others were so curious about our data and products that they could try right away. Some important topics are for example pricing and bidirectional charging.

## That's the moment when the dots connect:

- You see why you're writing code.
- You feel the impact your work can have.
- You realize it's not just about building features, but about shaping real experiences for people.

## My takeaway:

Building technical expertise is crucial. But asking why we do our work — and connecting it to real-world outcomes — makes all the difference. That's why I encourage people to go out of the office to business events and connect with people.

## Question for the Community:

Which event do you recommend most in E-Mobility sector?

One of the events I will recommend is the coming Ladeinfrastruktur conference 2025 from BMV together with NOW on the 20. Nov. 2025. See you there! 😇
