&quot;I only created two pull requests last month. Two!&quot; 😅

In my very first posts I&apos;ve written that I want to spend 20% of my time coding but in reality maybe 1%?

As I prepared a purpose &amp; role workshop for my team, I took a moment to reflect on my own role.

And guess what? Surprising surprising, my priorities have completely shifted. I am more of a tech leader who has an overview of all the ongoing projects and can help remove obstacles and provide guidance, but I don&apos;t get involved in writing coding itself anymore, max. reviewing code.

I was even much busier than before. So what have I been doing instead?

A lot — I wrote down in my notebook what I did so far.

## 👥 Team Building

- Established new routines and clear work structures
- Designed and facilitated our Purpose Workshop

## 📊 Projects and Planing

- Defined and prioritized projects
- Set clearer objectives and key results
- Delimit projects

## 🧭 Management &amp; Control

- Results tracking
- Handled administrative and compliance topics

## 🤝 Stakeholder Management

- Built bridges and communication channels across teams
- Removed roadblocks and aligned expectations

## 💰 Resource Management

- Managed budgets and working student position
- outsourced projects to service partners

## 🎉 Motivation &amp; Culture

- Recognized achievements and high performers and celebrated project milestones
- Promoted continuous learning and growth

I&apos;ve learned that leadership is less about coding — and more about building clarity, connection, and culture. 🌱

Do I miss coding? Sometimes.

Do I regret this shift? Not at all.

Seeing my team progress and grow every day is the most rewarding pull request of all.

💬 **How about you — what was the biggest shift in your role when you moved into leadership?**
