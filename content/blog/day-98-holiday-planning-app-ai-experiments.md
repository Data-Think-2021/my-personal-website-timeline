Are you still managing team holidays with endless Excel sheets?

After jumping from one meeting to the next with barely a moment to breathe and code, I recently felt that familiar frustration:

I miss building things. I had ideas in my head, but no time to get my hands dirty and code.

Last weekend, inspired by Alexey&apos;s recent Substack on experimenting with AI tools, I finally took a break from the chaos and decided to create something again.

## The Result

👉 **A full-stack Holiday Planning App.**

Not a simple static page — a real app with structure and logic.

### Under the hood:

✅ **Supabase Postgres Database**

✅ **Secure Authentication** (Admins invite users)

✅ **Different UI + permissions for each role**

✅ **No more static spreadsheets for each year**

✅ **Integrated school holidays and German national holiday**

## 🧪 Tools I Tested

### ChatGPT for better prompts

I uploaded a final design photo of the app and used ChatGPT to refine my prompts.

### 💙 Lovable

I entered the prompts to create a beautiful UI and design web. Much cleaner output than Cursor.

### 💻 Cursor

Ran into repeated bugs — I tried fixing them 6–7 times — but it struggled with the complexity.

### 🚀 Google Antigravity (Gemini 3 Pro)

Solved the bug on the first attempt.

Great error explanations + step-by-step implementation help.

This was the strongest overall experience.

## 🔧 ✨ My Takeaway

**AI is an incredible creative accelerator if you actually use it.**

Don&apos;t overthink — just test, build, break things, and try again. I often hear people say they want to &quot;develop themselves in AI,&quot; yet take no action.

For anyone curious about AI development:

**Start experimenting. It&apos;s the fastest way to learn.**
