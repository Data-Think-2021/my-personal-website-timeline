On my very first day, I caught myself thinking:
&quot;Am I really ready for this?&quot;

A new leadership role, a new team, new expectations. The truth? I felt a mix of excitement and anxiety.

Fast forward four weeks — the biggest lesson I&apos;ve learned is this: **you don&apos;t have to do it alone.**

Here&apos;s what made the difference:

## A role model

My previous team leader. I told her after week one that I&apos;d carry many of her practices forward — no need to reinvent the wheel. She was happy to hear that.

## A strong supporter

My Divisional Head. She doesn&apos;t just &quot;check in&quot; — she creates space for regular, honest exchange.

## A structured learning path

I joined &quot;The successful start to a leadership role&quot; with leadership coach Dagmar. It provides essential tools and coach sessions for leadership and communication.

What I&apos;ve realized: **nothing is original and asking for help is essential.** Standing on the shoulders of others not only saves time, it builds confidence.
