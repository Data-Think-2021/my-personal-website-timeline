On this lovely Saturday, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the period from August 2020 to September 2025.

In August 2020, I graduated at home during the pandemic.
Exactly five years later, I am taking on a new role as Head of Data & Cloud.

This journey has been a transition — from a **full-time mom starting from zero** to a **woman in tech and leader**. I tell people I lucked out. But I know luck has little to do with it. This was accomplished by **planning, persistence and execution**.

The challenges I faced were real:

- Two small children (1 and 4 years old)
- Not good enough German skills
- A foreign degree of automotive engineering
- No automotive industry in Berlin
- No relatives or nanny support in Germany

But I had a clear plan: to dive deep into Data Science, become a data scientist, and — at the same time — be **a role model for my children**.

## Here's What That Looked Like in Action

✅ **Invested 2 years and 16,000€** in my second full time master study of data science at HTW. I was not satisfied with the provided curriculum. I worked my ass off. I was determined to work harder than any fellow students in my class and completed extra curriculum like Machine Learning & the whole Deep Learning courses series from Andrew Ng and many more on Coursera during my study.

✅ **Continued upskilling after work**: Full-stack web develop bootcamps, iOS & Swift Bootcamp, data engineering zoomcamp, ML Ops zoomcamp, many more.

✅ **Gained AWS and Google Cloud training & certifications**.

✅ **Attended networking events** where some wonderful women helped change my career path.

✅ **Changed jobs quickly** when I felt stuck.

My advice for young professionals (especially women) in your early career phrases or transition:

💡 **Learning rate is at the beginning even more important than salary**. You should learn as much as you can either from some courses, from work, from colleagues. If you don't learn, you might need to take action immediately.

💡 **Never underestimate a small chance in the beginning**. I was also struggling to find a job after graduation. But thank to each opportunity I had before, I could continue improving myself and getting better chances.

💡 **Career and kids are possible**. Learn, grow and share the journey with your kids. Every time when mine asked, "Mom, what did you learn today?" — that kept me going.

💡 **Get support from your partner**. Without my husband as cheering leader at my side, this journey would definitely be more difficult.

💡 **Stay curious and you can always learn from everyone you meet**.

## Final Thoughts

To anyone facing the same obstacles: your path might not be easy, but it is possible and unique.

As a thank-you to the community that supported me, I'm offering a few free mentoring sessions in my limited free time. If you're interested, check out my website (thanks to vibe coding😉).
