I once thought (naively) that my brain would no more feel that heavy if I don't have to dive deep into coding and logical problem-solving. Turns out, I was wrong.

Leading a team comes with a different kind of "mental sport." My brain feels even heavier after work, and the task list somehow grows longer—without even speaking to all teams yet.

So now: shut down the PC, stop thinking, and go for a walk with Happy. So glad to have pets.
