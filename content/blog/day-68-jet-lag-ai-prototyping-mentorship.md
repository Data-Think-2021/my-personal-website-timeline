What will you do if you wake up at 2am due to jet lag?

Me: write 2 linkedin posts and create a new tool thanks to KI. Prototyping is extremely fast.

I mentor a girl to find her first job as fresh graduate in US. The job market is brutal. I never imaged how difficulty it becomes. Due to AI the employment of junior is down 30%. We face a problem. In 10 years we might do not have seniors more because we dont take any time to invest to develop them to senior.

It took me only 30 Minutes for this tool. Create 2 API keys to get jobs texts and Openai API to use LLM to analyse the text. I am quite satisfying with it. It just works. Do you know who much time and money to protopye this kind of tool before?

Anyway, good morning the world. I need to wake up my children and prepare breakfast for me. Have a nice day!
