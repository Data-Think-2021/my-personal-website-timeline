Today marks my first 100 days in this role — and in an unexpected twist, I&apos;m celebrating it over lunch with our CEO. A coincidence that perfectly mirrors this journey so far: challenging, energizing, surprising, and full of opportunities I could never have imagined a year ago.

These first 100 days have taught me more than any book, training, or certification ever could. Stepping into a new leadership role means listening deeply, building relationships, earning trust, and creating earned value. My focus has been on team building, prioritization, budgeting, resourcing, and personal development.

## Team Feedback

To wrap up this 100-day challenge, I&apos;m closing with the positive and encouraging feedback I received in recent development conversations with my team:

**&quot;Decision-friendly, clear guidance and prioritization, results-driven, supportive, reliable, and approachable, contributing to a positive team atmosphere.&quot;**

It&apos;s clear what the team needs — and I&apos;m committed to delivering it. I&apos;m structuring, guiding, empowering the team.

## What&apos;s Next?

The next 100 days will bring exciting new projects, fresh challenges, and new team members. I&apos;m looking forward to continuing this journey with my team and this momentum.
