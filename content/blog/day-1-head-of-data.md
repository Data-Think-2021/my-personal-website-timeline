# Day 1: Starting My Journey as Head of Data and Cloud

Today marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in my career. After months of preparation and anticipation, I officially stepped into my role as Head of Data and Cloud at NOW GmbH.

## What I'm Most Excited About

The opportunity to lead a team and shape the data strategy of our organization is both thrilling and humbling. I'm particularly excited about:

- **Building a data-driven culture** across the organization
- **Mentoring and developing** my team members
- **Driving innovation** in our cloud infrastructure
- **Creating impact** through strategic data initiatives

## First Day Highlights

- Kicked off and greet my team and expressed my appreciation and vision
- Conducted 1:1s for better understanding each other
- Introduced DWH Roll in CEO & COO board

## Challenges I'm Anticipating

While I'm excited about the opportunities, I'm also realistic about the challenges ahead:

- **Balancing technical work with leadership responsibilities** I am very clear that I don't want to give up hands-on. Especially at the early stage of a leading position it's more important to stay curious and block time for technical work. 
- **Managing stakeholder expectations** while building new capabilities
- **Ensuring team alignment** during this transition period

## My Commitment

Over the next 100 days, I'm committed to:

1. **Learning** - Understanding every aspect of our current data operations
2. **Leading** - Providing clear direction and support to my team
3. **Delivering** - Achieving measurable improvements in our data capabilities
4. **Growing** - Continuously developing my leadership skills

## What's Next

Tomorrow, I'll meet other team leaders from our department. I'm also looking forward to my first tech & code meeting and pair programming session.
