When I first joined my team, I introduced daily check-ins after talking with each team member. As someone new to the leadership role, I framed it as a trial — we&apos;d decide together after one month whether to keep it.

Yesterday, I had to make a tough call: we will keep the daily check-in. While I remain flexible on the timing, I believe strongly in the value of this practice. Some expressed their concern on the flexibility.

But here&apos;s what I see:

✅ **Faster alignment, fewer misunderstandings**

✅ **Improved communication and higher productivity**

✅ **A place to ask questions openly**

✅ **Obstacles solved more quickly**

✅ **Stronger team connection in a remote setup**

I also recognized a mistake on my part: by presenting the check-in as optional, I tried to please everyone — when in fact, I already knew it was essential for me as a leader. This was a valuable learning moment — not every decision can (or should) be fully collaborative. Sometimes, leadership means making a call while still being open to feedback.

What I&apos;ve learned in these first weeks is that it&apos;s normal for both the team and the leader to go through a period of adaptation. Change isn&apos;t always comfortable, but when done thoughtfully, it can strengthen collaboration.
