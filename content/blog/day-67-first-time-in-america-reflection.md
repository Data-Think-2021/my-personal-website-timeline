# Day 67/100 as Head of Data & Cloud

My first time in America — I have a mixed feeling of grateful, worried, and inspired all at once.

## Grateful

Grateful for the privilege of a German passport that made travel so easy. Astonishing the entry fee by land increased from $6 to $30 from the 1. September. We drove from Toronto to US.

## Visiting the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island

Visiting the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island made me think deeply about the American Dream — what it meant 80 years ago and what it has become today.

It also made me think about how current politics often move in disappointing directions — sometimes forgetting those very foundations of openness and inclusion.

## Visiting the Canadian Museum of History

Both countries remind us of their immigration roots.

Canada and the US share so much, yet my friend who lives in Canada and works in the US told us the difference. Canada is much more social, more caring — healthcare, education systems, and mindset.

## Doing Business

Doing business there feels easier, faster, and freer — less bureaucracy, tax, and willingness to take risks. Sadly, in Germany, bureaucracy often kills that spirit of innovation and drive.

## Chinatowns and Food Trucks

Chinatowns and food trucks in each big city— My stomach likes.

## Some Realities

Some realities were hard to ignore: too many (big) cars, too much plastic, traffic jams in big cities everywhere

People are friendly, open and kind. It took me a moment to get used to being greeted with &quot;How are you doing?&quot; by nearly everyone — a small question that I like.

The US government shutdown was disappointing — almost all museums closed.

I noticed social contrasts too, like who rides the buses — it made me reflect on equality and opportunity.

## My Favorite City

My favorite city: Washington D.C.

The landscapes in both countries were breathtaking — even though we only saw a tiny slice of it, about 2,400 km

## Highlight for the Kids

Highlight for the kids during the trip: Halloween in Toronto.

As said it&apos;s really a tiny piece of the land we visited for a short duration. But definitely worth it. Do you have anything to add or correct from my observation?
