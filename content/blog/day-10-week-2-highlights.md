One of today's highlights was our weekly tech & code session with pair programming time.

The goal of these meetings is simple: share knowledge across the team, reflect on the week's learnings, and dive into complex code, data and cloud topics together. It's always a great feeling to solve complex problems as a small group. We managed to migrate repositories from AWS CodeCommit to GitHub, with the existing CodePipeline and build triggered smoothly via the GitHub connector. The pipeline was successful! 🚀

Another milestone was the handover of data engineering responsibilities for an important dataset into the right hands:

- **The domain team takes ownership and engineering work** of the data. Being closest to the data, they understand its context best.

- **The central data team provides standardized tools and infrastructure** to allow domain teams to easily build, deploy, and share their data products. — following a data mesh approach.

👉 I'm curious: How does your team enable knowledge transfer and learning? And how do you approach data ownership in your organization?
