It provided not only practical advice about the industry and local opportunities but also reassurance that balancing career and family is possible.",

She has helped me tremendously with mock interviews, deepened my understanding of different roles in data, and clarified how my desired role as a data analyst collaborates with other data positions. She also encouraged me to join DataTalks to gain hands-on experience with data engineering projects. I had a great time learning from her and highly recommend Xia as both a mentor and a data peer.",
