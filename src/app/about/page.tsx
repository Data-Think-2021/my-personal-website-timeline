              Hey there! I&apos;m Xia, a curious, open-minded, slightly risk-loving human who believes in working hard, learning constantly, and experimenting new things.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              I live with my family in Kleinmachnow, which is located the southwest of Berlin. I&apos;m a mom to two kids, one samojede dog, and two cats. Life isn&apos;t a straight line upward for me‚Äîit bounces up and down. But I&apos;ve come a long way‚Äîfrom a farming family in rural China, to studying in Italy, France, and now Germany.‚Äîand I know I&apos;ve been both lucky and prepared when opportunity knocked. üçÄ

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Hobbies? Kind of!</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              A few years ago, my hobbies were mostly just &quot;trying to sit down in my own garden for a tea,&quot; but I&apos;ve managed to sneak in: Gardening (a.k.a. outdoor therapy), Sewing clothes for my kids and now even for myself, Yoga üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, dog walking, and building my website and ios app.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Cool Things I Did Recently</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Last year, I initiated two community-driven projects that made me feel all warm inside:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>
                <strong>The Working Mom Project</strong> ‚Äì a support initiative for moms preparing to return to the workforce.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Asian Cooking Classes</strong> ‚Äì something I organized for my German neighbors to share culture and food.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">What&apos;s Next? üöÄ</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              This year, I&apos;m trying something new: <strong>Freelancing Fridays!</strong> I&apos;m dipping my toes into freelance work with a mission to help and empower women, moms, and people with migration background to chase their careers and financial independence. üí™‚ú® Independence is extremely important to me when I overcome my midlife crisis recently.
