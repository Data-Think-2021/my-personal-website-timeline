14:Td8d,<p>On this lovely Saturday, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the period from August 2020 to September 2025.</p>
<p>In August 2020, I graduated at home during the pandemic.
Exactly five years later, I am taking on a new role as Head of Data &#x26; Cloud.</p>
<p>This journey has been a transition — from a <strong>full-time mom starting from zero</strong> to a <strong>woman in tech and leader</strong>. I tell people I lucked out. But I know luck has little to do with it. This was accomplished by <strong>planning, persistence and execution</strong>.</p>
<p>The challenges I faced were real:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two small children (1 and 4 years old)</li>
<li>Not good enough German skills</li>
<li>A foreign degree of automotive engineering</li>
<li>No automotive industry in Berlin</li>
<li>No relatives or nanny support in Germany</li>
</ul>
<p>But I had a clear plan: to dive deep into Data Science, become a data scientist, and — at the same time — be <strong>a role model for my children</strong>.</p>
<h2>Here's What That Looked Like in Action</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>Invested 2 years and 16,000€</strong> in my second full time master study of data science at HTW. I was not satisfied with the provided curriculum. I worked my ass off. I was determined to work harder than any fellow students in my class and completed extra curriculum like Machine Learning &#x26; the whole Deep Learning courses series from Andrew Ng and many more on Coursera during my study.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Continued upskilling after work</strong>: Full-stack web develop bootcamps, iOS &#x26; Swift Bootcamp, data engineering zoomcamp, ML Ops zoomcamp, many more.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Gained AWS and Google Cloud training &#x26; certifications</strong>.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Attended networking events</strong> where some wonderful women helped change my career path.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Changed jobs quickly</strong> when I felt stuck.</p>
<p>My advice for young professionals (especially women) in your early career phrases or transition:</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Learning rate is at the beginning even more important than salary</strong>. You should learn as much as you can either from some courses, from work, from colleagues. If you don't learn, you might need to take action immediately.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Never underestimate a small chance in the beginning</strong>. I was also struggling to find a job after graduation. But thank to each opportunity I had before, I could continue improving myself and getting better chances.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Career and kids are possible</strong>. Learn, grow and share the journey with your kids. Every time when mine asked, "Mom, what did you learn today?" — that kept me going.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Get support from your partner</strong>. Without my husband as cheering leader at my side, this journey would definitely be more difficult.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Stay curious and you can always learn from everyone you meet</strong>.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>To anyone facing the same obstacles: your path might not be easy, but it is possible and unique.</p>
<p>As a thank-you to the community that supported me, I'm offering a few free mentoring sessions in my limited free time. If you're interested, check out my website (thanks to vibe coding😉).</p>
