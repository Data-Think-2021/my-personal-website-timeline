14:T640,<p>When I first joined my team, I introduced daily check-ins after talking with each team member. As someone new to the leadership role, I framed it as a trial — we'd decide together after one month whether to keep it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I had to make a tough call: we will keep the daily check-in. While I remain flexible on the timing, I believe strongly in the value of this practice. Some expressed their concern on the flexibility.</p>
<p>But here's what I see:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Faster alignment, fewer misunderstandings</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Improved communication and higher productivity</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>A place to ask questions openly</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Obstacles solved more quickly</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Stronger team connection in a remote setup</strong></p>
<p>I also recognized a mistake on my part: by presenting the check-in as optional, I tried to please everyone — when in fact, I already knew it was essential for me as a leader. This was a valuable learning moment — not every decision can (or should) be fully collaborative. Sometimes, leadership means making a call while still being open to feedback.</p>
<p>What I've learned in these first weeks is that it's normal for both the team and the leader to go through a period of adaptation. Change isn't always comfortable, but when done thoughtfully, it can strengthen collaboration.</p>
