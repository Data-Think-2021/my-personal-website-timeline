14:T80b,<p>Last week reminded me why I love mentoring and giving back.</p>
<p>Two women. Two different journeys. One powerful message: when people believe in themselves, doors open.</p>
<h2>✨ K.'s Story</h2>
<p>K. shared the most exciting news with me: she had received two freelance offers as a creative creator via LinkedIn. LinkedIn has been a real game changer for her. I was so impressed that she found her first customer shortly after restarting after just one month.</p>
<h2>✨ T.'s Story</h2>
<p>T. shared that, after submitting numerous applications, she had been invited to two interviews and had just nailed her last one last week. She asked how she could prepare even better, so in the next session we're going to do a mock interview. Every practice brings you closer to achieving your goal.</p>
<p>We meet only once a month. I don't guide every small step. I don't have all the answers for them.</p>
<p>My role is to give them constructive input and recommendations, to encourage them to trust their potential and to believe in themselves.</p>
<p>Both K. and T. are the kind of people you want on any team — motivated, proactive, communicative, full of real good ideas and willing to grow. I've learned as much from them as they have from me. <strong>Mentoring is never one-directional.</strong></p>
<p>Looking back at my own early career, I remember how much confidence I lacked.</p>
<p>And I'm grateful for the people who saw something in me before I could see it myself.</p>
<p>If you're reading this and you're still finding your voice, your direction, or your confidence — don't give up. Sometimes all it takes is one person who believes in you… and sometimes that person has to be you.</p>
<p>What is your experience of mentorship? Do you have any good recommendations for a mentorship program?</p>
