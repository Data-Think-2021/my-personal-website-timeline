14:T832,<p>Are people still learning Machine Learning or Deep Learning? Or am I already outdated?</p>
<p>AI and agents are talked about everywhere. "AI experts" are springing up overnight. Almost every coach, consultancy, or startup all has AI in their portfolio.</p>
<p>It's as if you're not part of the conversation unless you talk about AI.</p>
<p>And yes — it is the best time to explore bold business ideas with AI.</p>
<p>But I can't help noticing something: many people are skipping the fundamentals and jumping straight into building.</p>
<p>I'm the kind of person who needs to understand the foundation before I feel comfortable using it.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, I completed Andrew Ng's Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses.</p>
<p>My first job was in text mining and NLP, back when language models struggled to even grasp relationships and meaning in text.</p>
<p>That foundation shaped how I view the progress of AI today.</p>
<p>Because while tools and frameworks evolve fast, <strong>the principles remain the same.</strong></p>
<p>Most companies I see still need solid data engineers and cloud experts before they are ready to deploy AI models.</p>
<h2>So here's my advice to those passionate about AI:</h2>
<p>Start by understanding the fundamentals. Learn how models work, how data trains, and why infrastructure matters.</p>
<p>And if you want to learn from the best — Stanford just released their CS230 (Autumn 2025) course for free, starting with Introduction to Deep Learning by Andrew Ng. Here is the link to the free course: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NLHFoVNlbg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NLHFoVNlbg</a></p>
<p>I'm curious —</p>
<p>👉 <strong>Who's still taking Andrew Ng's ML or DL courses in 2025?</strong></p>
<p>Let me know in the comments — I'd love to hear your learning stories!</p>
