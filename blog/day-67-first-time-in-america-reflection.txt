14:T9f2,<p>My first time in America — I have a mixed feeling of grateful, worried, and inspired all at once.</p>
<h2>Grateful</h2>
<p>Grateful for the privilege of a German passport that made travel so easy. Astonishing the entry fee by land increased from $6 to $30 from the 1. September. We drove from Toronto to US.</p>
<h2>Visiting the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island</h2>
<p>Visiting the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island made me think deeply about the American Dream — what it meant 80 years ago and what it has become today.</p>
<p>It also made me think about how current politics often move in disappointing directions — sometimes forgetting those very foundations of openness and inclusion.</p>
<h2>Visiting the Canadian Museum of History</h2>
<p>Both countries remind us of their immigration roots.</p>
<p>Canada and the US share so much, yet my friend who lives in Canada and works in the US told us the difference. Canada is much more social, more caring — healthcare, education systems, and mindset.</p>
<h2>Doing Business</h2>
<p>Doing business there feels easier, faster, and freer — less bureaucracy, tax, and willingness to take risks. Sadly, in Germany, bureaucracy often kills that spirit of innovation and drive.</p>
<h2>Chinatowns and Food Trucks</h2>
<p>Chinatowns and food trucks in each big city— My stomach likes.</p>
<h2>Some Realities</h2>
<p>Some realities were hard to ignore: too many (big) cars, too much plastic, traffic jams in big cities everywhere</p>
<p>People are friendly, open and kind. It took me a moment to get used to being greeted with "How are you doing?" by nearly everyone — a small question that I like.</p>
<p>The US government shutdown was disappointing — almost all museums closed.</p>
<p>I noticed social contrasts too, like who rides the buses — it made me reflect on equality and opportunity.</p>
<h2>My Favorite City</h2>
<p>My favorite city: Washington D.C.</p>
<p>The landscapes in both countries were breathtaking — even though we only saw a tiny slice of it, about 2,400 km</p>
<h2>Highlight for the Kids</h2>
<p>Highlight for the kids during the trip: Halloween in Toronto.</p>
<p>As said it's really a tiny piece of the land we visited for a short duration. But definitely worth it. Do you have anything to add or correct from my observation?</p>
